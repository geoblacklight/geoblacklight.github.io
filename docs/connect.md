# Connect with the GeoBlacklight Community

## GeoBlacklight is more than just software. It's a community. There are lots of different ways to connect and get involved.

- ### Participate in a Community Sprint
		   
	The GeoBlacklight Community collaborates on a 2-week sprint every Winter and Summer. Participation in the sprint is open to anyone interested in working on GeoBlacklight. While similar to a traditional code sprint, the GeoBlacklight Community Sprints also include tackling issues around documentation, metadata, community governance, and more. 
		
	[Read about our sprints](../blog/category/sprints/)

  
- ### Discuss on GitHub
		  
	Find a bug you want to report? Is documentation missing or unclear? Would you like to suggest a new feature? Anyone can create an issue on GeoBlacklight's GitHub issue tracker.
		
	https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight

- ### Share Metadata
	
	GeoBlacklight gets even better when organizations share metadata. Contribute your metadata to OpenGeoMetadata or use it to populate your own GeoBlacklight installation.
