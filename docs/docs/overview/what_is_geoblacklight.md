# What is GeoBlacklight?

GeoBlacklight is an open-source [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) software application for discovering geospatial content, including GIS datasets, web services, and digitized paper maps. Based on the popular open-source software project [Blacklight](https://projectblacklight.org/), GeoBlacklight began in 2014 as a collaboration by MIT, Princeton, and Stanford aiming to build off of the successes of the Blacklight Solr-powered discovery interface and the multi-institutional OpenGeoportal federated metadata sharing communities. As of 2022, it is used by over 25 academic libraries and cultural heritage institutions to provide a search engine across a federated catalog of geospatial data. For examples of how GeoBlacklight is used by our community, view our [gallery](https://geoblacklight.org/).
