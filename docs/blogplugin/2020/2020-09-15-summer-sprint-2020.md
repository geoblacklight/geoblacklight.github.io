## 2020 Summer Community Sprint

Our [Summer Community Sprint](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/projects/8) concluded in August 2020 and resulted in a [new version of GeoBlacklight](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/releases)! Version 3 brings us the long awaited multiple downloads option, support for Rails 6, and many improvements for accessibility.

### Notable Activities and Enhancements

* MULTIPLE DOWNLOADS: To learn more about how to format metadata for multiple downloads, review [How to configure multiple download links](https://opengeometadata.org/configure-external-links/#multiple-downloads)

* NEW NAME FOR THE DEFAULT BRANCH: We changed the name of the default branch to “Main.” There is a growing consensus in the development world for projects to change the default branch of their code in GitHub away from "master," as this is a loaded, potentially offensive, term. Read more about it here, including comments from our community: [https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/issues/940](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/issues/940)

* ICONS: We deprecated the geoblacklight-icons project, which relied upon font-awesome for the icons. Now, new SVG images can be submitted directly to the GeoBlacklight repository  or added in your own GeoBlacklight application.

* METADATA SCHEMA WORKGROUP: During the sprint, we convened a Metadata Schema Workgroup to assess the current GeoBlacklight Schema 1.0 and develop an upgraded version. The workgroup will continue to meet throughout 2020.

* COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE & VALUES: We also kicked off new discussions of how to be an equitable and inclusive community. These discussions are ongoing - check out our new [About page](https://geoblacklight.org/about), where we will be adding more soon.


Thanks to everyone who participated with code development, feature review, and metadata assessments. Consider joining us for the next sprint!
