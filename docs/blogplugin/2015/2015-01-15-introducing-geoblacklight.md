description: 'A quick introduction to the GeoBlacklight project and this blog.'
---
This blog serves as an announcement and engineering blog for developers and the larger [GeoBlacklight][geoblacklight] and geospatial communities. We aim to share our experience with creating the GeoBlacklight project, preserving geospatial data in a repository, engineering challenges to overcome, and other related topics.

[GeoBlacklight][geoblacklight] is an open-source collaboration between several institutions, with a goal of building a better way to discover, share, and access geospatial data. The main software project ([GeoBlacklight][geoblacklightproject]) is a powerfull discovery and geospatial search application. Built as a [Ruby on Rails][rubyonrails] gem, GeoBlacklight based on the popular open-source discovery software [Project Blacklight][blacklight]. We hope you will take a minute to check out the project, connect on [Twitter][twitter], or join the [Google Group][googlegroup].
