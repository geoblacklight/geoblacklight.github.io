# Announcing the GeoBlacklight Community Winter 2021 Sprint

## Tracks for the Winter 2021 Community Sprint
This sprint will encompass three tracks:

#### Track 1. Metadata
The [GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema Workgroup](/projects/geoblacklight-schema/index.html) is developing a new version of the metadata schema. During the sprint, we will need developers and metadata specialists to review and implement the new schema.

#### Track 2. Community
Our community is growing! We are working on developing a governance framework, documenting our values, and developing a 2021 Roadmap. During the sprint, we will need people with project management and documentation skills to help move us towards improvements in our community organization.

#### Track 3. Software maintenance
This one is especially for Ruby on Rails programmers and any GeoBlacklight users who like to troubleshoot!  The sprint is a good time to fix bugs and look at dependency upgrades.
