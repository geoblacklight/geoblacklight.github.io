# GeoBlacklight v4.1 released along with new documentation pages

## Summary

The GeoBlacklight Community held a community sprint in June 2023 and produced a [new minor release of GeoBlacklight](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/releases/tag/v4.1.0), new & improved documentation pages, and a platform upgrade of the GeoBlacklight website.

## New GeoBlacklight Features

### Display Note field

[Version 4.1](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/releases/tag/v4.1.0) supports the latest [OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark field, Display Note](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#display-note). This field presents a prominent shaded box with a message to the user that can be coded by color and icon. The messages can be labeled as `Danger` (red), `Info` (blue), `Tip` (green), `Warning` (yellow), or nonspecific (grey).

### Location inset for scanned map images

We added a location inset map that appears on the item view page for scanned maps hosted with IIIF. This shows users a bounding box of the area represented on the scanned map.

### Additional built-in icons

As new institutions join the GeoBlacklight community, we add their institutional logo to our icon library for interoperable display alongside their metadata records. New icons added to this release include:

* University of Arizona
* American Geographical Society Library - UWM Libraries
* University of Nebraska
* Rutgers University

### Improved item relations widget

Version 4.0 (September 2022) introduced item relations widgets to capture a variety of relationships as set out by the OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark schema.  The latest release improves the display in several ways:

* All widget labels now match their metadata field names
* For parent pages, the widget will now include a truncated list of child items along with a list to browse all child items; [fixed issue #1290](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/issues/1290)
* For items using `Replaces` and `Replaced By`, GeoBlacklight will only query the `Replaces` field, but will display relationship widgets for each item; [addressed issue #1264](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/issues/1264)

* New page for configuring the [Catalog Controller (`catalog_controller.rb`) file](https://geoblacklight.org/docs/configuration/catalog_controller/) to customize facets, metadata fields, search behavior, and basemaps.

### OpenGeoMetadata
