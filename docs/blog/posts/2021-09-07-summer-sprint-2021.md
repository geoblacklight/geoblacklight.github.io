# New releases after the GeoBlacklight Community Summer 2021 Sprint

The GeoBlacklight Community completed another Summer Sprint, held from August 30 to September 3, 2021. 

<!-- more -->

The overarching goal of this sprint was to develop a Version 4 release to support the <a href="https://opengeometadata.github.io/docs/aardvarkSchema">Aardvark Metadata Profile</a>. We ended up settling on a <a href="https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha">pre-release</a> to indicate that more testing and enhancements still need to be done. However, we did address several maintenance issues and updated the current release to <a href="https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/releases/tag/v3.4.0">version 3.4</a>.

Other activities included updating the project website, assessing existing metadata tools, and improving the application's fixture (sample) metadata records.

---------------------------

## Details
The sprint was divided into 3 overlapping tracks.


### 1. Usability

The Usability team focused on how to integrate  Aardvark metadata into GeoBlacklight's default user interface. Activities:
- added new metadata fields to the item view page and search page facets 
- created a mockup showing how to display the new item relationships available with the new Aardvark fields
- updated the default order of the search facets to reflect the user studies reported in two journal articles:
	- <a href ="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19386389.2020.1915459">Mapping Search Queries to Metadata Fields in a GeoBlacklight Repository</a>
	- <a href ="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/12932">Usability Analysis of the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal: Findings and Recommendations for Improvement of the User Experience</a>
- determined the rules and configuration options for icon display

### 2. Application Development (Software maintenance & coding)

The Application Development team focused on fixing deprecation warnings and incorporating the changes specified by the Usability track group.

#### Current release: Version 3.4.0
This <a href="https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/releases/tag/v3.4.0">minor release</a> includes maintenance issues and a few enhancements:
- addressed numerous deprecation warnings inherited from the <a href = "http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight software</a> that will enable us to use Blacklight's Version 8 (still in development) in the future.
- fixed a homepage map bug
- updated the default interface with improved search result sorting options

### 3. Documentation (Metadata, website, and migration guides)

The Documentation team made assessments of existing metadata documentation and began the process of migrating the content to a new GitHub pages site in the OpenGeoMetadata organization. The latest documentation can be found here: <a href="https://opengeometadata.org">https://opengeometadata.org</a>

More documentation work is on the way in the form of workflow recommendations for converting metadata from the GeoBlacklight 1.0 schema to the newer Aardvark profile.
