# Add thumbnail images

The [GeoBlacklight Sidecar Images](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight_sidecar_images) plugin adds support for harvesting remote images from geographic web services.

### Requirements

GBL Sidecar Images requires:

* [Ruby on Rails 5.2](https://rubyonrails.org/category/releases)
* [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick)

A background job processor like [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) is optional, but highly recommended.
