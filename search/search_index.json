The biggest evolution is the adoption of fields and concepts associated with the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) standard and the Project Open Data Metadata Schema, V. 1.1, including distribution fields. Distribution fields allow for increased flexibility in providing links to download multiple formats, pointing to reference codebooks and documentation, and integrating seamlessly with web APIs, such as GeoServer and IIIF endpoints. In the coming months, we expect the user interface of GeoBlacklight to reflect some of these new possibilities.</p> <p>For now, the team has created a development branch of GeoBlacklight for the new schema that includes example fixture documents of DCAT-compliant records. There are implications for moving toward the DCAT standard, the most significant of which is the need to \"flatten\" fully realized .JSON-LD metadata into .JSON files that comply with the Solr cores behind GeoBlacklight.

This included removing anticipated deprecations and incorporating Bootstrap 4.0 principles, such as a stylistic switch from pixels to rems.</p> </li> <li> <p>DOWNLOAD PANEL: The work to stay current with Bootstrap resulted a redesign of the Download tool to display a link to a direct download of the original dataset in one panel, with generated exports from a geospatial web server available underneath.

Here is a screenshot of the new layout:</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>METADATA BUGS: A few long standing bugs or omissions involving metadata interactions were addressed. The latest release allows certain characters, such as colons, in the record slugs, and handles empty values for the Geometry Type field. A new key was also added for the <code>dct_references</code> element to display native HTML records in the metadata viewer.</p> </li> <li> <p>INTERNATIONALIZATION: There is now better support for internationalization on view page elements - We fixed many lingering elements that had been hard-coded into English and turned them into translatable elements, which ultimately makes GeoBlacklight more accessible for use in other languages.</p> </li> <li> <p>TESTING WORKFLOWS: The GeoBlacklight GitHub repository was migrated to CircleCI instead of Travis CI for continuous integration and the metadata fixture records used for testing numerous functions were cleaned up and supplemented with new examples.</p> </li> <li> <p>LEAFLET MAP: Leaflet was upgraded to version 1.0, which required a few updates to the code. (Note - users looking to upgrade to the latest release of GeoBlacklight should check the release notes for potential issues with Leaflet 1.0 compatibilities.) The Leaflet map preview also includes new default basemaps - Now, users can toggle between seven default, open-source basemaps to use within the application.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2018/08/2018-summer-code-for-geoblacklight/#moving-forward","title":"Moving forward","text":"<p>The work on the summer has left us in a good place to cut a major 2.0 release of GeoBlacklight that will rely on upgraded frameworks.

These fields are used to highlight important information about a resource that users need to be aware of before accessing or using it. For example, a warning might indicate that the resource is incomplete or may be difficult to use due to technical limitations. A tip might provide guidance on how to use the resource effectively, such as suggesting specific software or tools that are compatible with the data. </p> <p>The main downside of custom fields is that they are not interoperable; when we share metadata across institutions, this information is lost. Another drawback is that custom fields require local development time to implement as opposed to functionality that comes with GeoBlacklight out-of-the-box.</p> <p>During the sprint, we devised a single field to capture this information, called \"Display Note\". This versatile field is inspired by website widgets known variably as callouts (general usage), admonitions (Python Markdown), or alerts (Bootstrap). Callouts are generally highlighted in colors and/or icons that indicate the type of information being offered, such as a red background for a Warning.  </p> <p>Details about the new field:</p> <ul> <li>URI: <code>gbl_displayNote_sm</code></li> <li>Multiplicity: this field is an array that can have multiple values</li> <li>Syntax: type of callout: text of callout</li> <li>Example value: <pre><code>[\n\"Warning: This text (starting with 'This text') will be displayed in a red box\",\n\"Info: This text (starting with 'This text') will be displayed in a blue box\",\n\"Tip: This text (starting with 'This text') will be displayed in a green box\",\n\"This is text without a tag and it will be assigned the default 'note' style\"\n]\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Right now, the field can be added to your GeoBlacklight Solr instance as a simple string field. In the next sprint, we plan to add functionality to GeoBlacklight that will automatically read the first part of the field (ex. Warning:) and display the text with highlight background prominently on the page. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/03/winter-sprint-2023/#versioning-and-roadmaps","title":"Versioning and roadmaps","text":"<p>We have a new Technology Matrix that maps out our GeoBlacklight release plans and technology dependencies.

COGs are an extension of the traditional GeoTIFF file format, optimized for cloud storage and web access, while PMTiles offer a method for storing and accessing numerous map tiles in a single, streamlined file. Both formats are designed to improve efficiency and speed across the web by utilizing HTTP range requests. This allows users to request only parts of the data, rather than entire datasets or images, distinguishing these formats from traditional geospatial web services like WFS or ArcGIS REST services. Both of the new viewers use OpenLayers instead of Leaflet, which, up until now, has been the only mapping library for GeoBlacklight. </p> <p>Overall, the integration of IIIF Manifests, COGs, and PMTiles into the latest version of GeoBlacklight reflects a growing trend in data sharing, moving away from the convention of offering discrete, downloadable files and toward a more dynamic model of streaming data.</p> <ul> <li> <p></p> <p>COGs viewer in GeoBlacklight    </p> </li> <li> <p></p> <p>PMTiles viewer in GeoBlacklight </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2024/02/winter-2024-sprint-wrap-up---geoblacklight-v42/#clover-for-iiif-manifests","title":"Clover for IIIF Manifests","text":"<p>In earlier versions, GeoBlacklight was limited to displaying single-part images through the IIIF Image APIs, requiring anyone interested in showcasing multipart images via IIIF Manifests to integrate a custom viewer.
