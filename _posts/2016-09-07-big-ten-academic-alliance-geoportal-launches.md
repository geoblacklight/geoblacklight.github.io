BIG SAMPLE CHANGE

Congratulations to the [Big Ten Academic Alliance team](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/cic-geospatial-data-discovery-project/home) that just launched their new [GeoBlacklight instance](https://geo.btaa.org/)! This project entailed over 20 team members from ten different institutions working together to create metadata, build policies, publish papers, and develop software. Make sure to checkout the new site here: [https://geo.btaa.org/](https://geo.btaa.org/).

The undertaking by this team is truly remarkable. You can read more about the project in [this blog post](http://geospatialmetadatalibrarian.blogspot.com/2016/08/big-ten-academic-alliance-geoportal.html) by Karen Majewicz. Also note worthy is that all of the metadata powering their GeoBlacklight instance is now up on [OpenGeoMetadata](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata).
